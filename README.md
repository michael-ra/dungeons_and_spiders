#### A C++ 'game-template' made for AlgoViz

AlgoViz is used to teach C++ at the university Osnabrueck.<br />
This project was developed in a few days to power our 2d dungeon crawler in AlgoViz, which was our final project for a module.<br />

 There are a few enemy classes included here as well as a 2d world generator with dynamic world templates as well as pathfinding. <br />
 Please note that the visual part is not included as it is done with AlgoViz - which is a university Osnabrueck specific library. <br />
